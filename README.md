# 📚 Library Management System - OOP Mini Project

## 📝 Objective

The goal of this task was to develop a simple **Library Management System** using **Java** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. The system allows managing books and users, including book issue and return functionalities.

## 🧩 Key Concepts Used

- **Abstraction**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Encapsulation**
- **IS-A / HAS-A relationships**
- **Constructor Chaining**
- **Method Overriding**
- **Dynamic Binding**
- **Super Keyword**

## 🔨 Implementation Steps

1. **Created Classes**:
   - `Book`: Represents a book with attributes like title, author, and availability.
   - `User`: Represents a library user with user details and borrowed books.
   - `Library`: Handles the logic for issuing and returning books, and storing the collection.

2. **Implemented Functionalities**:
   - Add new books to the library.
   - Register new users.
   - Issue a book to a user.
   - Return a book to the library.
   - Display available and issued books.

3. **Followed OOP Design**:
   - Used constructors, getters/setters, and lists to manage entities.
   - Encapsulated data and logic inside appropriate classes.
   - Used inheritance where applicable to demonstrate IS-A relationships.
